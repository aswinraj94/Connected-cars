#Connected-Cars

This project addresses traffic management by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. The objective is to design a circuit that ensures, using a list of junctions and their corresponding timestamps, that no two vehicles are at the same junction simultaneously.

In this iteration, we are working with:

9 junctions
4 cars, each passing through 4 junctions.
For each car, we record the times at which it passes through its designated junctions. The circuit verifies that no two cars pass through the same junction at the same time
